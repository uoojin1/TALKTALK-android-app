# TALKTALK-android-app

My first mobile application that was used by a student comunity in University of Toronto.

Talk Talk Radio, is a UofT korean student association that shares various school related stories/thoughts to the Korean students in UofT via SoundCloud.

They requested for a mobile application that the student can use to listen to their episodes.

## Main features 

1. Executive Member Introduction
2. Listening to the episode with soundcloud
3. Sending Ideas to the association anonymously
4. Fun original game
